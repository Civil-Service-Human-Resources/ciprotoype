It also helps increase local growth by creating jobs and supporting businesses.<br />We own public land, which we sell to house builders and others. This is one of the ways in which we overcome barriers to development and help increase the speed with which house builders can build new homes.<br />Homes England is an executive non-departmental public body, sponsored by the Ministry of Housing, Communities & Local Government.<br />    <br />Homes England was launched by the Secretary of State on 11 January 2018.
